--- INFORMATION

This is a (somewhat incomplete) native Ruby API interface to the C++ XQuery
library Zorba. It was written to meet the requirement of another project when
the only interface I could find was the very basic SWIG interface included in
the project.

I'm releasing it in the hope it will be useful to other people. If there is
interest then I'm happy to let it mature into a release quality product. If not
I'll just keep it up to date with whatever I need for my project.

Please let me know if you use this project for anything.

Thanks,

James Pharaoh

--- BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

* Install the ruby module development requirements. On debian this is provided
  by the ruby-dev package, or similar.

* Install zorba. I built this from source - http://www.zorba-xquery.com/.

* Run "ruby extconf.rb", the exact command I run is: 
  "ruby extconf.rb --with-zorba-include=/usr/local/include/zorba"

* Run "make".

* Require "zorba" in your ruby program. You'll either need to make sure
  zorba.so is in your ruby library path or use the full path name (minus the
  .so extension).

* Check out test.rb, my basic test script, for some basic examples.

Please let me know if you have any problems.
