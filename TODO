- handle ruby exceptions properly
- memory management, garbage collection
- lots of missing functionality
- translate c++ examples to ruby and get working
- unit tests
- documentation
- ruby gem

MEMORY MANAGEMENT
- is hard
- some callbacks pass ownership: use delegate
- is the api reentrant, eg what should be prevented from a callback
- destruction order
- mark and sweep
- priorities:
  - work like c api
  - work like a ruby api
  - protect against anything dumb
